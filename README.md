# [Image Sort](https://github.com/Racopokemon/ImageSort)

Simple javafx app that lets you cycle through the .jpg files in a folder, and organize / index / sort them: 
* click and hold inside a photo to zoom (zoom adjustable)
* delete or backspace instantly move the shown image to a '/deleted' folder
* up and down change the category of the shown image, it may either be kept in the directory or moved to one of the subfolders 1, 2 or 3
* keys a, b, c, d to have a copy of the images into the corresponding folders
* the copying to the folders a, b, c, d and the moving to the 1, 2 and 3 folders is done when the application is closed (with user confirmation)

# Installation
* Requires windows, use the `.msi` installer or the portable `.zip`, available at the *releases* section to the right! 
  * If you don't have Windows ... contact me, porting the app to linux or mac should not be a big thing. 

# Supported formats / extensions
