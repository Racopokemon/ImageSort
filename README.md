# Image Sort

Simple javafx app that lets you cycle through the .jpg files in a folder, and organise / index / sort them: 
* delete or backspace instantly move the shown image to a '/deleted' folder
* up and down change the category of the shown image, it may either be kept in the directory or moved to one of the subfolders 1, 2 or 3
* the moving to the 1, 2 and 3 folders is done when the application is closed
Yeah, thats it already. But it really comes in handy when you got a bunch of vacation pics and quickly want to select the best ones to share with your friends. 

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
